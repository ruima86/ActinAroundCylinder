This project is to study the compressive force generated by actin filaments around a cylinder. In order to properly compile the files, Armadillo, which is a c++ library for linear algebra and scientific computing, needs to be installed.

main.cpp            The main file to run the simulation.
filament.hpp        The file to define a filament class
filament.cpp        The file to include all the methods of the class filament
connection.hpp      The file to define a crosslinker class
connection.cpp      The file to include all the methods of the class connection
script.sh           The script to submit the job on the cluster
